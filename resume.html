        <!-- Professional Summary -->
        <section class="resume-section">
            <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
            <p>Decorated U.S. Air Force veteran with 10 years of service, bringing invaluable military-honed skills in leadership, discipline, teamwork, and problem-solving. During my Air Force career, I oversaw construction projects and teams under high-pressure conditions, developing a strong work ethic and adaptability that civilian employers value. I hold an A.A.S. in Construction Technology and a B.S. in Computer Science/IT (Software Development), and I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Cloud Computing Systems. This unique blend of hands-on project management experience and advanced technical education positions me to excel in the tech industry. Notably, cloud computing jobs are projected to grow 25% in the next decade, and I am aligning my career with this demand—seeking opportunities in cloud infrastructure engineering, DevOps, or software development where I can deliver the same level of mission-focused dedication and results that defined my military service.</p>
