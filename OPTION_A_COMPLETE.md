## 🔌 Connect Discussion Board to AWS

The discussion board is ready for your AWS setup. To connect it:

### Option 1: Use Existing AWS (Recommended)
You already have AWS infrastructure for Dave Notes. Just:

1. Create Lambda function: `discussion-create-message`
2. Create Lambda function: `discussion-list-messages`
3. Create DynamoDB table: `DiscussionMessages`
4. Update `discussion.js` with your API endpoint

### Option 2: Keep it Simple
The discussion board works now with demo data (stored in browser).  
Good for testing and showing the UI!

## 💼 LocalWeb Scout (Option B)

We can build this later when you're ready! It's a bigger project that includes:
- Business search tool
- Lead management CRM
- Portfolio showcase
- Proposal generator
- Email outreach

**Recommendation:** Get comfortable with Option A first, then tackle Option B when you want to actively pursue web design clients.
